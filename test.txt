Thomas was a regular guy, living a regular life. He had a 9-to-5 job, a coffee addiction, and an uncanny ability to get lost in places he had been a hundred times before. But one night, as he was walking home after a long day of spreadsheets and coffee breaks, something extraordinary happened.

The sky above him darkened suddenly, as though the stars themselves had been startled into silence. He stopped in his tracks, eyes wide, heart racing. A strange hum filled the air, followed by a blinding flash of light. Before he could even process what was happening, a beam of green light shot down from the sky and surrounded him.

Thomas barely had time to scream before he was lifted off the ground, his body levitating as if gravity had momentarily given up on him. The next thing he knew, he was aboard something that could only be described as a flying saucer, floating through the air with an eerie silence.

Inside the craft, the air was cool and smelled faintly of something metallic, like the inside of a spaceship (because, Thomas would later admit, he’d seen enough sci-fi movies to recognize the vibe). The walls of the craft shimmered with strange lights, and hovering in front of him were three creatures—tall, slender, with big, black eyes that seemed to gleam with curiosity.

"We are the Xrithians," one of them said in a voice that sounded like it was both inside Thomas’s head and all around him at once. "You have been selected for a most... unique experiment."

Thomas opened his mouth to protest, but before he could, the creature waved its long, spindly arms, and suddenly Thomas found himself lying on a cold, metallic table. He was restrained—gently, but firmly—as though the aliens knew exactly how much panic he was capable of.

The Xrithian closest to him took a long, deliberate sniff, its large eyes narrowing in concentration. "Hmmm," it said, clearly fascinated. "You are not what we expected."

The other two aliens leaned in, also sniffing the air. Thomas, panicking now, blurted out, "What... what do you mean? Why am I here? What are you going to do to me?!"

"Do to you?" one of them repeated, as if the question were strange. "We are going to taste you, human. Your species is known for its peculiar... flavor profile."

Thomas blinked, unable to process the meaning of this statement. "Taste me? You mean... eat me?" he stammered.

The Xrithian gave him a look of pity. "Not exactly. More like... sample. We are highly selective eaters. It’s part of our intergalactic culinary tradition."

Before Thomas could scream, one of the aliens unfurled a long, slender appendage and touched his face. A soft, humming noise filled the room, and then the creature’s mouth opened—not in a way that Thomas could ever have predicted. It was a smooth slit that expanded like a flower blooming, revealing rows of bioluminescent teeth.

With a sickening slurp, the Xrithian pulled Thomas toward its maw, and in an instant, he was sucked in.

The world turned into an odd mixture of slimy textures and shifting lights. He could hear the aliens talking—though their voices now sounded muffled, like he was submerged in water. Their words, unintelligible, faded in and out as he was slowly, inexorably, pulled deeper into the creature’s mouth.

Thomas didn’t know if it was the complete panic or the absurdity of the situation, but he couldn’t help thinking: *This is it. I’m actually being eaten by aliens. And I didn’t even get to finish my coffee.*

But then something very unexpected happened. The aliens began to... cough?

The creature that had swallowed him started making strange, guttural noises, followed by what could only be described as a horrible gurgling sound. Thomas, still in the slimy, unsettling place, felt a sudden surge of movement—he was being expelled.

The alien’s mouth opened wider, and the next thing Thomas knew, he was shot out with such force that he landed with an undignified thud on the cold metal floor of the spaceship.

The three aliens stared at him, horrified, as they recoiled, their large eyes blinking in what could only be described as disgust. One of them made a high-pitched noise—a sound like a cross between a dog whimpering and a dial-up internet connection.

"He tastes terrible," the first alien said, backing away. "Horrible. What... what did we do wrong?"

"Must have been the... *seasoning*," the second one replied, rubbing its elongated fingers together. "Perhaps too much starch. Or maybe it's the coffee?"

"Indeed," the third alien said with a shake of its head. "This experiment is a failure. We shall not try it again."

Thomas, who had somehow managed to regain his composure, stood up shakily. "Wait," he said, feeling the odd combination of frustration and relief. "You're telling me I—*I*—wasn't good enough to eat? You... *threw me up*?"

The aliens stared at him for a moment, then looked at one another, clearly puzzled. One of them shrugged its spindly shoulders and said, "We have different tastes. Not every species is suitable for our... discerning palates."

Without another word, the aliens turned toward a control panel, and the ship hummed to life, slowly lowering itself toward the ground.

Thomas, still a bit stunned, watched as the hatch opened. The aliens looked at him one last time, as though expecting him to say something profound.

"Goodbye, *Thomas*," one of them said, almost apologetically.

With that, he was unceremoniously dropped back onto Earth, landing with a soft thud on the grass. The ship zipped away into the night sky, vanishing in an instant.

Thomas sat up slowly, brushing off dirt and grime, still processing what had just happened. He looked up at the stars, shaking his head.

“Well," he muttered to himself, "at least I can cross *being eaten by aliens* off my bucket list.”

And with that, he stood up and walked home, determined to get a fresh cup of coffee. Because after all, if there was one thing he could count on to taste good, it was coffee.

But he had to admit, the idea of *tasting* bad to an alien still left a bitter taste in his mouth.
